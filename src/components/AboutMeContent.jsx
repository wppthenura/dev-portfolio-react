    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Pulindu Thenura, a motivated and dedicated software engineering
      undergraduate currently in my second year at Plymouth University. With
      strong hands-on experience in full-stack development, I also work as a
      Music Copyright Associate at Orfium Sri Lanka, where I apply my technical
      and analytical skills in the domain of digital rights management.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about building solutions that combine functionality with
      user-centric design. I enjoy exploring UI/UX, IoT systems, and web and
      mobile development while balancing professional responsibilities and
      academics with effective time management.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond tech, I'm also a creative individual â€” a guitarist, singer, and a
      skilled communicator with leadership experience from my school years as
      Head Prefect and club president.
