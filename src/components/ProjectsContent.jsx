        <strong>ðŸ“± OstoCare (Mobile App)</strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "0.9rem", marginTop: "8px" }}>
          A healthcare application developed to support ostomy patients in Sri Lanka, featuring a clean UI, engaging UX, and logically developed tools for tracking and guidance.
          <br />
          This project was a major milestone in my journey as a developer, where I led the team and took charge of the full development process. Among my peers at NSBM, it stood out as the most logically structured and fully functional mobile app.
          <br />
          It is now being scaled towards an industry-level product, with plans to launch on the Play Store and App Store soon. The app was built using the Dart programming language and Flutter framework.

        <strong>3D Portfolio Website</strong>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "0.9rem", marginTop: "8px" }}>
         This 3D portfolio website is a fully custom built, interactive experience designed and developed entirely by me. 
         It blends modern web technologies with 3D graphics to showcase my projects, skills, and personality in a dynamic and engaging way. 
         The website is built using React for its component driven architecture and React Three Fiber, a React renderer for Three.js, to create immersive 3D scenes directly within the browser. 
         To enhance the development experience and simplify 3D object management, I used @react-three/drei, a utility library for common 3D patterns. The user interface elements, such as scrollable overlays and responsive layouts, are styled using Tailwind CSS, while Framer Motion adds smooth animations and transitions. 
         The project is deployed through Vercel, ensuring fast, serverless deployment and easy updates as I wanted my personal website to be. Everything is version controlled and publicly available on GitHub, 
         where others are welcome to explore.
